# Social_Network_Ads-using-Support-Vector-Machine
📚 Project Overview
This project applies a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to predict whether a user purchases a product based on their age and estimated salary. The dataset used is the Social Network Ads dataset, which consists of user information and purchase behavior.

The main goal is to classify users who are likely to purchase the product using a binary classification approach.

🚀 Key Objectives
Load and visualize the Social Network Ads dataset.

Preprocess the data using feature scaling and data splitting.

Train and evaluate the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Visualize the decision boundary and analyze model performance.
🔥 Model Training Process
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.

Splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

Scaling the features using StandardScaler.

Model Training:

Fitting an SVM classifier on the training data.

Tuning the hyperparameters using GridSearchCV (if applicable).

Model Evaluation:

Evaluating the model using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Plotting the decision boundary and confusion matrix.
